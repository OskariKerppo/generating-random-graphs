Generating random graphs

Generate Erdős–Rényi random graphs with ability to calculate many properties such as culstering and mean degree.
Also able to draw the networks and make histograms of degree distributions.

Getting Started
Clone to local repository. Install matplotlib package for python. That's pretty much it.
Consider modifying the arguments of the main function to your liking.

Prerequisites
matplotlib for plotting
Everything else is coded from scratch


Running the tests
Arguments in main function decide the size of the simulation. Arguments are number of nodes in networks, probability of edge existing between nodes
and number of generated graphs. G(n,p) networks are generated first and average properties calculated. G(n,m) networks
are generated with the average number of edges from G(n,p) networks. 

DON'T BE GREEDY
Simulations get very slow as number of nodes grows
